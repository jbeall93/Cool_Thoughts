# What is Surveillance Capitalism?

As you read this, the digital revolution continues to take place all over the world at a blistering pace; yet, we hardly ever discuss its ramifications. The concept of Surveillance Capitalism seeks to fill that void. At its most basic level, Surveillance Capitalism unpacks and explains how the digital world interacts with the real world and impacts human behavior on an unprecedented scale.

The term Surveillance Capitalism was coined by Harvard professor, social psychologist, and philosopher Shoshana Zuboff. She made it her mission to understand and demonstrate how the advent of the digital age has changed the way the social, economic, and political world order operates. In her book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Zuboff lays out her definitions of the term:

Sur-veil-lance Cap-i-tal-ism,

* A new economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction, and sales;
* A parasitic economic logic in which the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new global architecture of behavioral modifications;
* A rogue mutation of capitalism marked by concentrations of wealth, knowledge, and power unprecedented in human history;
* The foundational framework of a surveillance economy;
* As significant a threat to human nature in the twenty-first century as industrial capitalism was to the [natural world](Article3.md) in the nineteenth and twentieth;
* The origin of a new instrumentarium power that asserts dominance over society and presents startling challenges to market democracy;
* A movement that aims to impose a new collective order based on total certainty;
* An expropriation of critical human rights that is best understood as a coup from above: an overthrow of the peopleâ€™s sovereignty.

With these definitions in mind, it is important to make one clear distinction: there is a huge difference between the technology that makes Surveillance Capitalism possible and the phenomenon itself. Surveillance Capitalism is powered by humans with the ability to change the trajectory of this new economic logic, it is not some inevitable outcome of the advancements in technology humans have facilitated over the last century.

With that being said, we know that there is hope to change the trajectory of Surveillance Capitalism and create a more respectful economy that protects individuals and promotes healthy competition and sustainable growth. The first step towards realizing that goal is to educate ourselves about the world we live in and the systems of power and logic that guide our decisions.
