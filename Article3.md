# **The New Frontier Of Capitalism: A Global Perspective** #

<p>To expose the global scale at which surveillance capitalism operates it would be prudent to understand the historical currents of capitalism that gave rise to technology companies and connect them to previous frontiers of the capitalist market structure. In general, capitalism excels at creating, and then speedily exploiting, new resources and technologies. It is crucial to note that these responses do not always result in optimal human health and peace, but rather drive up countries GDP (the standard way of measuring a country's wealth) and private wealth. This is a gross oversimplification of the global economy over the last two centuries, but for the purpose of this article, this general idea provides a basic framework upon which to build.</p>

<p>Today we find ourselves at a crossroads in the history of capitalism. The last two centuries were largely defined by capitalism's incessant exploitation of natural resources. However, as governments and private investors increasingly realize the incredible damage that they have done to the natural world, and work to remedy their mistakes by mitigating the effects of climate change, capitalism has begun to pivot in its focus. Companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft now consistently rank as some of the most valuable companies in the world. In fact, if you look at a list of the highest valued corporations, most of the companies that show up are either directly or indirectly involved in the digital economy. This marks a seismic shift from an historical lens. In the past, all the highest valued corporations were involved in the plunder of natural resources, taking advantage of mother nature in the name of ever-increasing profits. But we are clearly making our way out of that phase of economic history and entering a new one. The frontier of capitalism defined by natural resources is (very slowly and painfully) fading into the distance.</p>

<p>The question then necessarily becomes: what is the new frontier of capitalism in the 21st century? The answer is simple: human data. Over the last twenty years human behavior has been increasingly commoditized just as the natural world was in the industrial revolution. We are living through a digital revolution that relies on human behavior to steer growth and profits. As Shoshana Zuboff points out in her book Surveillance Capitalism, "knowledge, authority, and power" have changed hands, they now "rest with surveillance capital, for which we are merely 'human natural resources'" (page 100).</p>

<p>So, how can we prevent this new phase of capitalism from being as destructive as the last? We clearly do not want to repeat dangerous unforeseen effects in this new digital age akin to the horrors of climate change. In this respect we can take many lessons from the failure to combat climate change. The challenge posed by surveillance capitalism is of nationalism and isolationism, just as in the case of climate change.</p>

<p>Technological disruption cannot be solved within the borders of certain countries, it must be a global effort. As Yuval Noah Harari succinctly states in his book 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, "research and development are not the monopoly of any one country, even a superpower such as the United States cannot restrict them by itself" (page 121). He goes on to point out just how little we know about the possible side-effects of the digital revolution, noting that "whereas nuclear war and climate change threaten only the physical survival of humankind, disruptive technologies might change the very nature of humanity, and are therefore entangled with humans' deepest ethical and religious beliefs" (page 121). This is the point where the global response to climate change and surveillance capitalism must diverge.</p>

<p>While most people agree that we should avoid climate disasters and nuclear warfare, no one agrees what should happen with technology. Despite differences on what should be done, most people agree that there is a problem with climate change and nuclear arms races. However, with technological disruption and ethics, there is no common framework of understanding or agreement to work from. However, if nothing else we have learned from our failure to protect mother nature; we must unite in a global response to technological disruption preemptively. If we do not, we could be fated to experience an encroachment on individual privacy, autonomy, and independence unprecedented in the history of humankind.</p>
